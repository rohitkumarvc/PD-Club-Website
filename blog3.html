            <p class = "blog">Modern science operates on the principle of reductionism, that is, reducing
    all phenomena in the universe including human behavior, to the
    interactions of subatomic particles acting according to natural laws and
    impersonal forces.</p><p class = "blog">
    Eminent scientists have expressed that this basic scientific methodology of
    reductionism is itself inadequate for understanding life in its completeness.
    Consider the statements of two Nobel Laureate Scientists:</p><p class = "blog">
    1. &nbsp;“I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around
    me is very deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our
    experience in a magnificently consistent order, but it is ghastly silent about
    all and sundry that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It
    cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain
    and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad,
    God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in
    these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not
    inclined to take them seriously.”&nbsp;-Physicist Erwin Schrodinger</p><p class = "blog">
    2. &nbsp;“I maintain that the human mystery is incredibly demeaned by scientific
    reductionism, with its claim in promissory materialism to account
    eventually for all the spiritual world in terms of patterns of neuronal
    activity. This belief must be classed as a superstition. … We have to
    recognize that we are spiritual beings with souls existing in a spiritual world
    as well as material beings with bodies and brains existing in a material
    world.”&nbsp;-Brain researcher John Eccles</p><p class = "blog">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequences On Human
    Values</p><p class = "blog">
    
    This incompleteness of the reductionistic approach has grave
    consequences on the entire worldview of modern human society; it is set
    to erode all that we cherish as humane and valuable.</p><p class = "blog">
    1. Consider, for example, the following statements of two eminent scientists,
    one spiritually-minded and the other not:</p><p class = "blog">
    
    “The most beautiful and most profound emotion we can experience is in
    the sensation of the mystical. It is a shower of all true science…. That
    deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power
    which is revealed in the comprehensible universe forms my idea of
    God.”&nbsp;– Albert Einstein</p><p class = "blog">
    “But now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry: I have
    tried lately to read Shakespeare and found it so intolerably dull that it
    nauseated me. I have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music… The
    loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness , and may possibly be injurious to
    the intellect, and more probably to the moral character, by enfeebling the
    emotional part of our nature.”&nbsp;– Charles Darwin</p><p class = "blog">
    1. Which fate do we want our children to meet?<br>
    &nbsp;“Man may be able to program his own cells with synthetic information
    long before he’ll be able to access adequately the long-term consequences
    of such alterations, long before he’ll be able to formulate goals and long
    before he can resolve the ethical and moral problems which will be
    raised.”&nbsp;– Noble Laureate Geneticist Marshall Nirenberg</p><p class = "blog">
    1. Indiscriminate scientific research in fields like genetic engineering and
    cloning is bound to raise far more problems than it can solve.
    &nbsp;“The legal issue of ‘responsibility’ seems to imply that there is indeed,
    within each of us, some kind of an independent ‘self’ with its own
    responsibilities – and by implications, rights – whose actions are not
    attributable to inheritance, environment ,or chance.” –&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicist Sir Roger
    Penrose</p><p class = "blog">
    1. If we accept the scientific version that we are genetically programmed
    machines, then will we be ready to allow a cold-blooded murderer to go
    scot-free on the grounds that “murder is programmed in his genes”?
    &nbsp;“We&nbsp; may well reach the point in not too distant future where the parables
    and images of the old religions will have lost their persuasive force even
    for the average person; when that happens, I am afraid that all the old
    ethics will collapse like a house of cards and that unimaginable horrors
    will be perpetrated.”- Noble Laureate in Physics Wolfgang Pauli. Unless
    one has an understanding of God as the Supreme Controller, the call to
    ethics has no weight. After all, what is there in an atheist’s world view to
    impel him to stick to morality in his pursuit of pleasure? If a person does
    not understand his identity as an eternal soul, if he thinks that he can get
    away with whatever he does, provided he just does it cleverly enough, why
    will he not try to maximize the pleasure that this life can offer him? “Beg,
    borrow, steal, kill, but enjoy” becomes the life’s motto of a spiritually
    unprincipled person.</p><p class = "blog">
    
    Paradigm Shift in Science</p><p class = "blog">
    
    Due to these ominous trends, intellectual trend-setters worldwide have
    started questioning the validity and utility of indiscriminate scientific and
    technological “advancement.” What is the purpose of scientific research?
    Human happiness. But if that is not being achieved, has science erred?&nbsp;
    Where? What can be done about it?</p><p class = "blog">
    Maybe its time for science to set its priorities right as was recommended
    by Micheal Faraday centuries ago, “We ought to value the privilege of
    knowing God’s truth far beyond anything we can have in this world.”
    Science may add years to our life, but only spirituality will add life to our
    years. Without spirituality, we have no answers to fundamental questions
    of value, purpose and meaning – all of which are critical for satisfaction
    and fulfillment.</p><p class = "blog">
    Moreover the reductionistic non-spiritual paradigm of modern science has
    not been proven, but presumed. This presumption was questioned by
    eminent scientist Louis Pasteur centuries ago “You pass from matter to life
    because your intelligence of today… cannot conceive things otherwise.
    How do you know that in ten thousand years one will not consider it more
    likely that matter has emerged from life?” Now in the light of devastating
    social ramifications, open-minded questioning has become vital for human
    happiness and even survival itself.</p><p class = "blog">
    Science needs to harmonize itself with the supreme scientist God, as
    recommended by Albert Einstein, “I believe in God – who reveals himself
    in the orderly harmony of the Universe. I believe that intelligence is
    manifested throughout all Nature.&nbsp; The basis of scientific work is the
    conviction that the world is an ordered and comprehensible entity and not
    a thing of Chance. When I sit here and watch the mighty ocean, I can
    imagine the treasures hidden below the bed of the sea, when I see the clear
    blue sky above, I feel sky is the limit.&nbsp; When I cast my eyes around I see
    the wonders and beauties of Nature.&nbsp; Science must learn to live in
    Harmony with all these magnificent gifts of God to Humanity.”</p><p class = "blog">
    Vedic Value-Based Spirituality</p><p class = "blog">
    “It is already becoming clear that a chapter which had a Western
    beginning will have to have an Indian ending if it is not to end in the self-
    destruction of the human race. At this supremely dangerous moment in
    history, the only way of salvation for mankind is the Indian Way.” This
    remark of Dr Arnold Toynbee (British Historian, 1889-1975) indicates that
    the best contribution of India to the world should not be in the form of
    software engineers, but in the form of spiritual engineers.</p><p class = "blog">
    If we want intellectually satisfying spiritual alternatives to the materialistic
    worldview offered by reductionistic science, India is our best hope. Many
    Western thinkers have acknowledged the glory of Vedic spiritual wisdom.</p><p class = "blog">
    1. &nbsp;“In religion, India is the only millionaire……the one land that all men desire
    to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, would not give that
    glimpse for all the shows of all the rest of the globe combined.”&nbsp;-Mark
    Twain</p><p class = "blog">
    2. &nbsp;“Whenever I have read any part of the Vedas, I have felt that some
    unearthly and unknown light illuminated me. In the great teaching of the
    Vedas, there is no touch of sectarianism. It is of all ages, climbs, and
    nationalities and is the royal road for the attainment of the Great
    Knowledge.” –American Thinker Henry David Thoreau</p><p class = "blog">
    3. &nbsp;“The marvel of the Bhagavad-Gita is its truly beautiful revelation of&nbsp; life’s
    wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion.”&nbsp;-Herman
    Hesse (1877-1962), German poet and novelist, awarded the Nobel Prize for
    literature in 19.</p><p class = "blog">
    4. &nbsp;“Best of books – containing a wisdom blander and far more sane than that
    of the Hebrews, whether in the mind of Moses or of Him of Nazareth. Were
    I a preacher, I would venture sometimes to take from its texts the motto
    and moral of my discourse. It would be healthful and invigorating to
    breathe some of this mountain air into the lungs of Christendom.”&nbsp;-Amos
    Bronson Alcott (1799-1888) writer, philosopher, visionary.</p><p class = "blog">
    5. “The message of the Gita is a universal call to Democracy, liberty for the
    peoples, liberty for each individual. The great affirmation of the Bhagavad
    Gita is that every individual, whatever he may be, rich or poor, can and
    must raise himself on life’s path and that he has a right to his
    emancipation, social, intellectual, and spiritual.”&nbsp;-Louis Revel, French author
    of The Fragrance of India: Landmarks for the world of tomorrow
    The glory of Vedic wisdom was seen in the caliber of its followers. When
    we become devoted to Supreme Intelligent, we become spiritual. This was
    the basis of the theistic Vedic social order. Moreover, another cardinal
    principle was: real human progress is measured not by the development of
    technological facilities, but by the development of spiritual qualities. The
    glorious social order as present in India (before its spiritual foundation was
    destroyed by the British imperial rule) was noted by British statesman
    Edmund Burke, “This multitude of men (the Indian nation) does not
    consist of an abject and barbarous populace, much less of gangs of
    savages; but of a people for ages civilized and cultivated; cultured by all
    the arts of polished life while we (Englishmen) were yet dwelling in the
    woods. There have been in (India) princes of great dignity, authority and
    opulence. There (in India) is to be found an ancient and venerable
    priesthood, the depositary of laws, learning and history, the guides of the
    people while living and their consolation in death. There is a nobility of
    great antiquity and renown; a multitude of cities not exceeded in
    population and trade by those of the first class in Europe; merchants and
    bankers who vie in capital with the banks of England; millions of
    ingenious manufacturers and mechanics; and millions of the most diligent
    tillers of the earth.”</p><p class = "blog">
    Great leaders of vedic knowledge have stated that the foundation for real
    peace can be established only by spiritual wisdom, “Unless there is an
    awakening of divine consciousness in the individual, there is no use of
    crying for world peace.” We need not mistake genuine devotion to be the
    irrational religious fanaticism seen in some parts of the world today. It can
    be analysed that the failings of such so-called religion as follows,
    “Religion without philosophy is sentimentalism or sometimes fanaticism,
    Philosophy without religion is mental speculation.” If there is systematic
    philosophical education, then spirituality far from leading to fanaticism
    will lead to real harmony with nature and the master of nature.</p><p class = "blog">
    India as a Global Spiritual Leader</p><p class = "blog">
    The Swiss professor Dr. Richard Ernst –the 1999 Noble prize winner in
    chemistry – when projecting the impact of science in this millennium, took
    special note of India’s past and her present intellectual potential for
    shaping humanity’s future;
    India has a well developed academic community with a surplus of highly
    creative scientists, perhaps with a special indication towards the more
    theoretical aspects of science and still maintain a link to the Indian
    culture…</p><p class = "blog">
    I am convinced that India could become once again the cradle of a new
    school of thought that may significantly influence the fate of the globe
    during the millennium. Perhaps the contribution of India to nuclear power
    technology and space science will turn out to be irrelevant, but the
    contribution towards a new ethical foundation could be turning the wheel
    of history in the proper (balanced) way.</p><p class = "blog">
    Eminent thinkers throughout the world, including leading scientists such
    as Nobel Laureate Richard R. Ernst, peace workers such as Nobel
    Laureates Oscar Arias Sanchez and Betty Williams, and spiritualists such
    as Nobel Laureate the Dalai Lama, firmly believe that only a synthesis of
    science and spirituality can lead the world out of the present troubled
    times.</p><p class = "blog">
    The youth of India have a unique position in the world. By virtue of birth
    in the holy land of India, they inherit the priceless wealth of spiritual
    knowledge expounded in the Vedic texts. And by virtue of their education
    and training, they have developed the scientific spirit of rational inquiry.
    Thus they are best suited to bring about the much-needed synthesis of
    science and spirituality that thinkers all over the world are searching for.
    The late Professor Arthur Ellison, a mechanical and electrical engineer,
    stated, “Surely the great and unique contribution that India has made and
    must continue to make to the world’s progress is in the field of religion–of
    truth and reality…. India can most certainly help the West to find the
    spiritual way back towards reality, which is essential for all real progress.”
    Unfortunately, most young Indians today are enamored by the razzle-
    dazzle of Western culture – blue jeans, supermarkets, Big Macs, Disney
    “fun,” rock music, Hollywood movies, and the like. But before embracing
    Western culture, wouldn’t it be worthwhile to study the condition of those
    who have lived with it their whole lives? Statistics show that in the U.S.A.
    a thousand teenagers attempt suicide every day. Seventy percent of all
    high-school seniors have attempted or seriously thought about suicide.
    </p><p class = "blog">
    Thirty-three percent of American adults have serious mental health
    problems. Psychiatry and psychology are the most lucrative professions in
    America, and among all professionals, the highest suicide rate is found
    among psychiatrists and psychologists. Yet for most Indians, America is
    the land of their dreams. Saintly scholars would lament that modern
    Indians are sitting on jewels and begging for broken glass. Let the
    intelligent youth of India become selfless spiritual scientists dedicated to
    saving the world from its suicidal course. Let them, in the true spirit of
    science, study the theory of spirituality with all seriousness and at the same
    time perform the experiment of mantra meditation. Those who take up this
    challenge will become living spiritual scientists and will help usher in an
    era of peace, harmony, and understanding.
